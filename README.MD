## Heroku server Node.JS application

- The heroku server Node.JS application is location at `server/elp-planngo` folder. This folder is a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). A submodule is a git repository in another git repository. This folder will be empty after you clone this repo.

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

- You can use the same commands to commit and push changes you have made just like any git repository in this folder. The githhub repository (root folder) will track the changes that were made in the heroku git repository.
